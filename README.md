Solona Data Prediction
Introduction
This is a project aimed at developing a model for predicting data using various machine learning techniques. The project uses Solona data as a sample dataset to train and evaluate the performance of the models.

Requirements
Python 3.x
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
Usage
Clone the repository
