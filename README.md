# Solona Data Prediction

## Introduction
This project is aimed at developing a machine learning model for data prediction using Solona data as a sample dataset. The project utilizes various machine learning techniques to train and evaluate the performance of the models.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x 
- scikit-learn 
- pandas 
- numpy 
- matplotlib

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/AnamolZ/Solona-Data-Analysis.git
2. Install required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter-notebook solona_data_prediction.ipynb
4. Follow the steps in the notebook to train the model and make predictions.

## Results
The models are evaluated based on accuracy and F1 score. The best performing model will be saved in the `best_model.pkl` file.
